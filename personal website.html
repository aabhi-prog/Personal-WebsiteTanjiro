        <h1>Tanjiro Kamado</h1>
        <h5>Sun breather</h5>
        <p>Hinokami Kagura (ヒノカミ神楽かぐら Hinokami Kagura?): During his near-death experience in his battle with Rui, Tanjiro awakened this in a memory of his father teaching him this Breathing Style. As his body was more suited to the Hinokami Kagura, he quickly overpowered the Lower Rank demon. However, the sheer force and fatigue it placed on his untrained body caused him to collapse and weaken significantly when using it, thus he only saved it for last ditch attempts to beat his adversaries.</p>
